# scDAVIS: single-cell Data Analysis and VISualization

Tool for visualize and do DE of analysis with Seurat in single cell RNA-seq

The aim of this tool is to help scientific who are studying single cell and have a previous analysis.

Firstly, scDAVIS allows to visualize metadata and qc (quality control) information about the experiment; and plot it in different graph such as histogram and violin plots. Moreover, the previous analysis should be get tsne and/or pca information in order to be able to plot the different cluster that are performed. Unless, this tool permit to create your own cluster by selecting manually the cells.

A different category that scDAVIS offers is the differencial expression analysis. It can be do with predefined clustering or with a custom clustering. Then it can be visualized in tsne or pca graph by representing the gene expression or in violin plot as well as HeatMap.

This tool is created by Juan Luis Onieva and Carlos Torroja with the collaboration of CNIC
